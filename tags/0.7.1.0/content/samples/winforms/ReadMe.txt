This is most complex sample, because you need to generate proxies and compile both C# and Java side.

1) Make sure you have environment prepared properly. See Read.Me file in root.

2) Look at the samples\winforms\winforms.proxygen.xml file. It defines what proxies will be generated.

3) Run samples\winforms\generateProxies.cmd, it will generate 
- Java proxies of .NET classes 
- and C# codebe-hind classes

4) Now you need to compile codebe-hind classes into assembly. 
- Start Vistua Studio 2008, 
- open samples\winforms\winforms.csproj
- compile it
- verify that files exist
samples\winforms\target\winforms.dll

5) copy all jni4net DLLs next to your winforms.dll
- start samples\winforms\deploy.cmd 

6) now compile Java part, proxies and Program.java
- start samples\winforms\build.cmd
- or run ant
- or build it in your Java IDE

7) run the test
- start samples\winforms\run.cmd
- or debug it step-by-step in Java IDE
