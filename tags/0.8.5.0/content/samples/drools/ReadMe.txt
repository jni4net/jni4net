drools-api-5.1.1.j4n - I used proxygen to generate wrapper around drools-api-5.1.1.jar
domain               - I translated fact object from drools tutorial to C#, there is 
                       dependency to jni4net because of java.util.Date, otherwise it's 
                       independent domain.
domain.j4n           - I used proxygen to generate wrapper around domain above. This is 
                       necessary to make the domain visible to drools engine on 
                       Java side.
examples             - I translated the drools tutorial from Java to C#. 
                       This is main program to run.
             
Notes:
I had to hack few files, because proxygen is not yet smart enough.
Particulary in domain.j4n, the C# constants are not generated into Java proxies by proxygen.
