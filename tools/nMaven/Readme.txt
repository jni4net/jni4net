At the moment the project seems dead. I don't have time to figure out which fork is the proper one.
This was taken from http://nmaven.codeplex.com/ and patched.
I uploaded the patch upstream.

It will produce artifacts with <version>0.17.jni4net.0</version>
I patched it for robocode originally, then for jni4net.

To build it just type mvn install
